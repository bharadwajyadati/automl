AutoML 

Features :
1) Automatic Data Cleaning
2) Automatic feature Extraction
3) Selecting the best model ensemble
4) Automatic hyper parameter tuning



Feature engineering
When you kick off training, AutoML Tables automatically performs common feature engineering tasks for you, including:

Normalize and bucketize numeric features.
Create one-hot encoding and embeddings for categorical features.
Perform basic processing for text features.
Extract date- and time-related features from Timestamp columns.

Parallel model testing
Linear
Feedforward deep neural network
Gradient Boosted Decision Tree
AdaNet
Ensembles of various model architectures



Parallel learning --> dask

bayasian optimization --> hyperparameter
